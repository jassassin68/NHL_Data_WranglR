# NHL_Data_WranglR
 
 Project built in the R language for wrangling, exploring, and modeling data for analysis of National Hockey League games and players

## Description

A repository of scripts I have developed myself for several purposes:
* Scrape NHL player statistics on a daily basis from Hockey-Reference.com, aggregate that day's data with historical data
* Aggregate historical Draftkings contest salary files and completed contest ownership files
* Take player statistics, Vegas odds data, and DraftKings data and combine those into one historical file for modeling purposes, specifically to create linear regression models in order to predict DraftKings points, player percentage ownership in cash games, and player percentage ownership in GPPs

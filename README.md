# NHL_Data_WranglR
 
 Project built in the R language for wrangling, exploring, and modeling data for analysis of National Hockey League games and players

## Description

A depository of scripts I have developed myself for several purposes:
* Scrape NHL player statistics on a daily basis from Hockey-Reference.com, aggregate that data with historical data
* Aggregate historical DraftKings contest salary files and completed content ownership files
* Take player statistics, Vegas odds data, and DraftKings data and combine those into one historical file for modeling purposes, specifically to create linear regression models in order to predict DraftKings points, player percentage ownership in cash games, and player percentage ownership in GPPs

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
